# Cooking
App made for storing your own recipes.

Why go look for your notebook when you can simply take out your phone and start cooking?

## Objectives
My objective with the development of this application is to help people with storing recipes. With it, people should be able to save their recipes on their phone, and, when the online service is available, use it in any device. Having a web version and a mobile version to make it more versatile and accessible to everyone.

By making this, I am able to develop my programming skills so that I code more and more efficientely.

My knowledge in GitHub is limited so that is also a way of me getting to know this tool more.

## How I am making it
I made this project using Flutter as the main resource (https://flutter.dev)

The app was initially built with Flutter `3.16.5-stable`, but then moved to `3.29.2-stable` due to deprecated libraries and unavailable components.

The version of flutter used is now: `3.29.2-stable`


# More detailed and important information about the development

## Building Locales

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

## Building the app:
### For Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Others
It's pointless to build for other systems, theapp wasn't made for `Windows` and I don't have a Mac System or a developer account to release the app to `iOS`.
