# Cooking
App made for storing your own recipes.
Why go look for your notebook when you can simply take out your device and start cooking?

## Objectives
My objective with the development of this application is to learn more about programming so that I know a good variety of programming languages.
And it's also meant to help my reputation when I go look for a job without only having the school certification.

## How was it made
I made this project using Flutter as the main resource (https://flutter.dev)
